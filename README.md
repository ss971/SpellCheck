Spell Checker with GUI

Overview

This project implements a spell checker with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter. It utilizes a word frequency-based approach to suggest corrections for misspelled words based on a reference text file (big.txt). The GUI allows users to input a filename containing text, checks the spelling, and provides possible corrections.

Word Probability Calculation: Uses word frequency from big.txt to determine likely corrections.
